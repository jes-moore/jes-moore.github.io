I had the opportunity to be interviewed by Brian Bain over at [Investor in the Family](http://investorinthefamily.com/introduction/). He took a break from his typical guests - hedge fund managers, portfolio managers, and finance journalists to interview me on a few of my more alternative views on technology. It was a lot of fun and cudos to Brian for making me look better than I should.
