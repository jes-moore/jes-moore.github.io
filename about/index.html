                    <p>Jesse has a very special combination of deep knowledge of data science and machine learning combined with very strong executive leadership skills all capped off with superb presentation skills. He's taken Sigmai from a disparate set of data components and NLP to a cutting edge data science company that is ready to shake up the Alternative Data market.</p>

                    <p>Jesse’s motivation and drive are second to no manager I have worked for in the past. I don't know where he found the energy to lead Sigmai's development of cutting-edge technology, prepare for investor and sales meetings with incredible diligence, and reflect on corporate strategy, all in a day's work.<br><br>
                        Working under Jesse’s self-reflective leadership style was also incredibly refreshing and enabled rapid personal development. Every week Jesse identified areas where his performance in business development, data science, and human resource roles could be improved. This example allowed him to hold his employees to the same standard. Everyone felt comfortable identifying and addressing uncomfortable truths whenever they arose.<br><br>
                        Above all, Jesse never passed off responsibility for mistakes or failures to those working for him. He shared the successes with his team and understood that disappointments and errors came back to him as the leader.</p>

                    <p>I mentored and worked alongside Jesse for three years where he excelled in a project management position at an early stage in his career. Jesse’s ability to handle multiple concurrent projects, tackle new/unique challenges on a daily basis and quickly upskill in new subject areas stands testiment to his adaptibility and intellect. <br><br>
                        Jesse was an excellent contributor and someone with the capability to tackle a range of complex problems, solve them methodically, and communicate results effectively. He was able to quickly grasp complex technical topics and maintained a deep understanding of business and the decision-making process and was able to identify process and operational risk. </p>
