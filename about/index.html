                    <h4 class="post-title">Craig Cook <span class="job-name">- CEO @ Mobilads</span></h4><br>
                    <p>Jesse came on board at mobilads as a part-time data scientist, but after quickly showing his skills we wanted to bring him on full-time. He's shown his ability to think creatively and strategically to fit his skill-set into what would most benefit mobilads in the long-term, and has treated mobilads as if it was his own company.</p>
                    <p>He continues to deliver what is expected and beyond, including new ideas and ways to attribute our data and GPS into something useable by clients and agencies.</p>
                    <p>Because he ran his own company (as a CEO), he's able to incorporate his ideas into the overall business plan for our company, something a lot consultants are not able to do, and something I've personally been very impressed by.</p>
                    <p>I highly recommend Jesse as an employee, consultant, and/or advisor with any project or company and as it relates to data science. </p>

                    <p>Jesse has a very special combination of deep knowledge of data science and machine learning combined with very strong executive leadership skills all capped off with superb presentation skills. He's taken Sigmai from a disparate set of data components and NLP to a cutting edge data science company that is ready to shake up the Alternative Data market.</p>

                    <p>Jesse’s motivation and drive are second to no manager I have worked for in the past. I don't know where he found the energy to lead Sigmai's development of cutting-edge technology, prepare for investor and sales meetings with incredible diligence, and reflect on corporate strategy, all in a day's work.<br><br>
                        Working under   Jesse’s self-reflective leadership style was also incredibly refreshing and enabled rapid personal development. Every week Jesse identified areas where his performance in business development, data science, and human resource roles could be improved. This example allowed him to hold his employees to the same standard. Everyone felt comfortable identifying and addressing uncomfortable truths whenever they arose.<br><br>
                        Above all, Jesse never passed off responsibility for mistakes or failures to those working for him. He shared the successes with his team and understood that disappointments and errors came back to him as the leader.</p>

Jesse’s ability to handle multiple concurrent projects, tackle new/unique challenges on a daily basis and quickly upskill in new subject areas stands testiment to his adaptibility and intellect. <br><br>
                        Jesse was an excellent contributor and someone with the capability to tackle a range of complex problems, solve them methodically, and communicate results effectively. He was able to quickly grasp complex technical topics and maintained a deep understanding of business and the decision-making process and was able to identify process and operational risk. </p>
